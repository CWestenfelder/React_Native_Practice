# React_Native_Practice
My first react native app. Mainly learning the language and how to use git. 

## What you'll need:
- Yarn (found here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Node.js (found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Your prefered editor

Documentation for React Native can be found here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
